            <h2>Summary</h2>
            
            <p id="cghost">
                Mr. Otis , an American minister, was looking to buy Canterville Chase, a castle that  belonged to Sir Canterville. The castle was not inhabited by the Canterville family for decades now, the reason being that it was believed to be haunted.

                Sir Canterville declared this upfront to Mr Otis, who discarding the haunted castle rumors offered to buy both the castle and ghost – at valuation.
                
                Mr. Otis moved into the castle with his wife, his son (Washington), his daughter (Virginia) and his two younger twins and were greeted by the castle housekeeper, Mrs. Umney.
                
                They noticed the blood stain in the hall and Mrs. Umney let them know that it was from when Sir Canterville brutally murdered his wife.
                
                The family was far from spooked by this – rather proceeding to grab their cleaning supplies to scrub that spot right off the floor.
                
                The stain came right off.
                
                The following days, the blood stain re-appeared – although what was noticeable was that blood stain had different hues each time.
                
                The family finally accepted there might be some truth to the rumors, but still went about their business as usual.
                
                The ghost finally made an appearance one night and Mr Otis was the one to see him, but instead of being scared – he requested  that he put some oil into the chains so that he didn’t make so much noise while walking around in the night.
                
                The ghost was surprised, as this was not the normal reaction he was accustomed to. Never in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three hundred years, had he been so grossly insulted.
                
                Taking this as an insult to his natural scaring power, he took it upon himself to make even bigger spectacles – what went on in the following days was actually opposite to what he imagined.
                
                The kids attacked him pea shooters, and played elaborate pranks on him – on one occasion even scaring with a replica skeleton. Insulted and tired, the ghost eventually retired to his own room – feeling even more depressed.
                
                Viriginia, Mr Otis’ daughter found him one day and was pained to see the ghost, visibly sad and distraught – who told her that he was very tired and had not slept in three hundred years.
                
                He asked for her help – knowing that she had a compassionate heart – unlike the rest of her treacherous family.
                
                She agreed to help him, although she was terrified of what lied ahead. They disappeared into a garden of death. 
                
                Desperate search ensued to find Virginia – who was nowhere to be found. The family was distraught, as was the Duke of Cheshire, who had been courting Virginia for quite some time now.
                
                Her mother was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, when Virginia finally came back to the house. She let the family know that Sir Simon Canterville, the ghost, was now at rest.
                
                The ghost, in turn, had left her a box of rare jewels as a gift for her help.
                
                Although Virginia never told anyone what happened in the garden of death, she always remembered Sir Simon with love and was thankful for sharing the wisdom:
                
                Love is stronger than life and death.</p>
