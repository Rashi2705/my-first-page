     <p id="datas">
        The book Data Structures Through C
        in Depth is primarily meant for computer science students who are learning C language. The book explains the essential 
    components of C language through the simplest ways, with illustrative examples. Ten chapters along with important questions
    and their brief answers are provided in the book. The most important highlight of the book is that it has been written 
    in accordance with the syllabus of two different examination bodies DOEACC society and the Indra Gandhi National Open
    University. Both beginner and advanced level students of C language get to learn a lot from the book. The book starts
    by providing a brief introduction to data structures, the basic concepts like pointers, arrays and structures are 
     explained in this chapter. Gradually, readers are approached with different topics like stack, queue, linked lists,
     recursion, sorting, tress, searching, hashing and graphs. Students are greatly benefited as they gain a better 
    understanding of crucial concepts. The important concept of storage management is explained briefly in an entire
    chapter dedicated to it.Data Structures Through C in Depth was published by BPB Publications in the year 2011 and is available in paperback binding.<br>The book explains thoroughly the essential components of C language through the most simple and easy to understand way possible, with abundant illustrative examples.
