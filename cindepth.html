                The book explains each topic in depth without compromising the 
                lucidity of the text and programs. This approach makes this book suitable for both novices and advanced programmers: the
                 well-structured programs are easily understandable by the beginners and useful for the experienced programmers.
                  The book can be used as tool for self-study as it provides step by step explanation and comes with solutions of all exercises. 
                  It explains all the basic concepts and doesn't assume that you know how to program. New features in the 3rd edition include a 
                  chapter on Recursion, through explanation of Bitwise Manipulation, new and improved programming examples, lots of new exercises
                   ranging in difficulty, solutions to all the exercises and a CD that includes of all the programming examples and exercises. 
                   The book contains about 310 well explained programming examples to drive the concepts home and nearly 450 exercises which
                    include many interesting and challenging programming exercises that will help you to sharpen your programming skill. 
                The chapter on project development and library creation can help students in implementing their knowledge.<br>As we know that C is the basic programming language for all the beginners. Currently I am pursuing B.Tech.

                This is an amazing book to learn C language deeply because in this book all the minor and major concepts are clearly describe that helps student to study.
                
                The  language is not hard, anybody can easily understand.
                
                If you don't know a single line of C language and want to learn C language deeply then I  suggest you to read this which tells you everything about C language deeply.</p>
