           <h3><b>FAMILY BACKGROUND</b></h3>
           <div>
<p> My grandfather is a farmer and my father is a shopkeeper. We have a shop in sanwer named <b>APNA SHOE SHOWROOM</b>. My grandfather is a Dentist.
My mother is a house wife. I have two younger brother HARSHIT and SANIDHYA. We have a small house and a farm in Sanwer,near Indore.
We used to have bull for farming but as the technology comes people started using tractors, I was very sad when my grandfather sold them, as they are no longer needed.
As the time passes we sold many things and now we don't have any animals, we used to have cows, buffalos but as no one has time to take care of 
them so my father sold them too. It was a very bad feeling to loose everything but as nowadays time is very important and no one has time to look after them.

           <h3><b>ROLE MODEL</b></h3>
           <div>
               <p>
                   My mother is my Role model. From childhood i wanted to be like her. She always supports me, always protect me. She teaches
                   me how to be a human being. I feel so good when my relatives says that "you are totally like your mother". I live in a society
                   where people do not know the importance to educate a girl child. At that time my mother take stand for me , supports me and my dreams
                   she always fight for me. She is my everything, my whole world.

           <h3><b>STRENGTH</b></h3>
           <div>
               <p>My patience is my strength. I analyse every situation before reacting to it. I am a good listener, in my friend circle i 
                   was the judge for any conflict. They always tell me the whole situation and then ask me who was wrong in this situation and 
                   who was right. I always listen to people first, then speak. I know myself very well. I know how i will react in that perticular
                   situations and that helps me a lot.
               </p>
           </div>
           <h3><b>weakness</b></h3>
           <div><p>My biggest weekness is that i come under other's influence easily. There is a saying that"you see things as you are not as they are"
               . I believe people easily and then get hurt. My other weekness is i am not good at communicating . I like silence and being alone. I find it difficult
               to interact with new people.
