        <p>When i was preparing for NIMCET i studied maths very seriously but never thought that there is something called discrete mathematics.I studies discrete mathematics in graduation but we were never taught its importance or its work in computer application,so i did not pay any attention that time,the only topic i knew was Boolean algebra. </p>
        <li><b>MY EXPECTATION</b></li>
        <p>I want to learn the importance and use of discrete mathematics in computer science.  I am very exited to learn a new topic in mathematics</p>

     <li><b>MY EXPECTATION</b></li>
     <p>I wanted to learn its practicle use.</p>
 </ol></div>
 <h4><li>OPERATING SYSTEM</li></h4>
 <div><ol>
     <li><b>MY PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE</b></li>
     <p> I only knew the types and theory portion of operating system.</p>
     <li><b>MY EXPECTATION</b></li>
     <p> I want to learn operating system in deep and enough knowledge so that i can built my own operating system at the end. </p>
 </ol></div>
 <h4><li>BUSINESS COMMUNICATION</li></h4>
 <div><ol>
